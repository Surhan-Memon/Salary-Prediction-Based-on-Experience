# Salary-Prediction-Based-on-Experience
This is a beginner-friendly Linear Regression project where I predicted Salary based on Years of Experience using Python. I worked with a small dataset of 30 entries and went through the full workflow: loading and exploring data with Pandas, splitting it into train and test sets, training a Linear Regression model with scikit-learn, making predictions, and evaluating the model using MSE and R² score. I also visualized the dataset and the regression line using Matplotlib, which helped me see how experience affects salary. This project helped me understand regression fundamentals, how to calculate slope and intercept, and how to check if a model fits data well. It’s a great practice for anyone learning the basics of machine learning and regression in Python.
